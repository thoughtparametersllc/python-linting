# Security Policy

Thank you for your interest in keeping the **Python Linting Action** secure. We take security seriously and value the input of the security community.

## Supported Versions

Because this Action uses a "floating tag" release strategy (e.g., `v1` points to the latest release), we generally only provide security updates for the **current major version**.

| Version | Supported | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| v1.x | :white_check_mark: | Current major version (Recommended) |
| < v1.0 | :x: | No longer supported |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please **do not open a public issue**. Publicly reporting a vulnerability can put the community at risk before a fix is available.

### 1. Private Reporting (Recommended)
If you have a GitHub account, please navigate to the **Security** tab of this repository and look for the **"Report a vulnerability"** button. This allows you to open a private advisory draft where we can discuss the issue securely.

### 2. Email Reporting
If private reporting is not enabled or you prefer email, please send a detailed report to:
**jason.miller@thoughtparameters.com**

Please include:
* The type of vulnerability (e.g., Command Injection, Dependency Issue).
* Full steps to reproduce the issue.
* Any relevant proof-of-concept (PoC) code or screenshots.

## Response Timeline

We are committed to addressing security issues promptly.
* **Acknowledgment:** We aim to respond to your report within **48 hours**.
* **Assessment:** We will review the report and determine the impact.
* **Fix:** If the vulnerability is validated, we will prioritize a fix and release a new patch version (e.g., `v1.0.2`).

## Scope

### In Scope
* Vulnerabilities in the Action's execution logic (e.g., arbitrary code execution via malicious input).
* Supply chain vulnerabilities in the Docker container or dependencies defined in this repository.

### Out of Scope
* False positives or false negatives generated by the underlying tools (Black, Pylint, MyPy). Please report those to the respective tool maintainers.
* Vulnerabilities requiring physical access to the user's machine.
